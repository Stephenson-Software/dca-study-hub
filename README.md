## ✅ Tips for Success

- Practice in the CLI daily — real command fluency matters  
- Use the [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/) during prep (and the exam — it’s allowed!)  
- Focus on **Swarm**, not Kubernetes  
- Don’t just memorize — understand *why* each feature matters  
- Take timed practice tests to build stamina and spot weak areas
