# 📋 Planning – DCA Study Hub

This document outlines initial GitHub issue ideas for expanding the repository content and implementing a companion website using Spring Boot. These are intentionally simple for now — refinement, prioritization, and scope definition can come later.

## 🧠 Content Expansion

### Issues

- Add deep dive on container lifecycle and namespaces
- Add checklist for practicing common `docker` commands
- Add notes on `docker-compose` vs `docker stack`
- Document Dockerfile best practices and examples
- Add section for exam-day tips and checklist
- Create section with real-world use cases for Docker
- Add section for Kubernetes basics (since DCA touches on it)
- Add glossary of key Docker terms
- Add links to external DCA prep courses (with short reviews)
- Add sample questions or quiz-style review sheet

## 🌐 Spring Boot Website (Public-Facing Companion)

### Overview

The idea is to build a lightweight Spring Boot site to present key repo content, track checklist progress (locally for now), and improve visibility.

### Issues

- Scaffold Spring Boot project (REST + Thymeleaf)
- Create `/` homepage route with intro and links to GitHub
- Add `Study Plan` page to show study-plan.md in readable format
- Add `Checklist` page that reads checklist data (initially static)
- Add `Commands` page showing docker-commands.md as interactive list
- Style site with basic Bootstrap or Tailwind
- Add "Contribute" page linking to GitHub discussions + issues
- Deploy MVP site to GitHub Pages or Railway.app
- Add SEO metadata and share preview images
- Link site in repo README

---

## 🛠 Future Ideas

- Add login and progress tracking with cookies or user accounts
- Support markdown parsing dynamically from repo files
- Turn checklist into interactive tool with localStorage
